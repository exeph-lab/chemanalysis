## DN scripts and programs

I decided to share my codes and programs on my own [repositories](https://github.com/D1s1ntegrator?tab=repositories) and [webpage](https://d1s1ntegrator.github.io/). <br />
The main reason is indexing. exeph-lab and chemanalysis does not appear on google. With my own webpage i can ask google to index it it so anyone interested in the specific topic can found my codes and programs.
